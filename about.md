I’m a passionate self-taught full-stack web-developer. Loves hacking with Ruby and Go. A Rails enthusiast *“i love to make web app”*. 

Loves an open source and free software. Mostly inspired by a software freedom activist and computer programmer  Richard Stallman 

<p class="message">
  “Free software is software that respects your freedom and the social solidarity of your community. So it’s free as in freedom.”

Built my first website with HTML when I was 15. Started learning *How to be Hacker* after watching [Swordfish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244/) while i was in high school. Since then I’ve been spending time building web apps and sites using various frameworks on Ruby, Nodejs & Golang.

By passion i am hacker “not one who steal information & credential” but instead help in spreading and contributing information. I have been researching since past few year mostly in Cloud technologies, Security Pattern & Data Science. Recently i have been learning, hacking and using MongoDB, Docker and Golang(mostly).




As to my academics study, i am doing my undergrad study in computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Allahabad(final year).
