When I first started to create my blog in WordPress, it was awful job to manage all CMS customization etc then again i tried Blogspot it was really easy to set up but all it was *Copy & Paste* not a platform to learn & hack with code.

While browsing through [Twitter](www.twitter.com/aruzmeister) i found awesome tool [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). First of all for beginners “Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby” it uses different technology like Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery, Saas etc to bring more awesomeness but you can hack it more to bring nectar out of Jekyll. Writing blog in simple markdown and pushing in github pages is really easy to be live. It was really….

* Easy to set up. 
* Easy to code. 
* Compact and fast. 

But these wasn't all i want, so i keep on hacking with Jekyll until then i found [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) which bought more customization, themes and template right on your plate. So using the fusion of *Jekyll + Hugo* i was able to bring my blog live which i hosted in my Github page. It is easy, fun & free. I believe in open source, so i have published my work here in my [Github](www.github.com/aruzmeister). You can hack it, rewrite it and change it
